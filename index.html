                    I was so sure I was immune to this until you crashed into my world. What began as a harmless crush I thought I could keep to myself, quickly grew into something far more than I expected. It was something you weren’t even supposed to know about. But with your existence, I knew I couldn’t hold myself back. The first time you replied to me, I was the happiest person alive. And then our conversations became a daily thing. Sharing secrets, laughing at silly jokes (mine and yours) and tolerating each other's cheesiness. Somewhere in between, my phone was filled with your photos and my notifications were all from you. And now, here we are, somewhere between friends and something I couldn’t say for now. You said I wouldn’t like you if I knew you better, but the truth is, the more I know, the more I fall. What started as something fleeting, now keeps me up at night, glued to my phone. I wouldn’t have it otherwise for anything in the world. 
                    You were always there, silently existing somewhere, our paths may have crossed countless times since grade school, yet we rarely noticed each other’s presence until June of 2024 when everything changed. I remember the first time I REALLY saw you. You were carrying something over your shoulder, as you were about to enter my aunt’s office, and in that instant, I knew I already had a thing for you. I like to think that we have looked at each other eye to eye which left me wondering as to which star had finally granted my wishes. Every time I tried to talk to you, even just lurking on your sisters or even your mum’s Facebook just to see your face (diri ak obsessed stalker ha, don't judge me) your smile would just… wreck me. Honestly, seeing you smile was often the highlight of my day. It was so natural for you and I still can't figure out how you managed to tear down all the walls I built.
